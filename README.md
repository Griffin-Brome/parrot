Parrot is a small and lightweight web app built with Python 3, using Flask. It takes an input in the form of a .txt file of sentences. It then generates a random paragraph from the source text using Markov chains. 

### Deploying Parrot
As Parrot is a Python application, it should be deployed to a WSGI server. [Here is some more information](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/#deployment)
